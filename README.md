## Overview of Analysis
This week W.Avy and I wrote some amazing code to discover temperature trends in Hawaii. Using python and SQLALchemy we filtered, analyzed, and converted data into lists so that it was easily digestable to our stakeholders. This go around we specifically looked at the months of June and December, and our results were extrordinary.
## Results
For the Month of December 
- The average temperature was 71 Degrees Fahrenheit
- The maximum temperature was 83 Degrees Fahrenheit
- The minimum temperature was 56 Degrees Fahrenheit

## Summary
Its safe to say the temperature is relitivley the same bvetween June and Decemebr minus a couple of degrees. Meaning, the shop should do relatively well.
These results do not include weather conditions that could lower the chances of a good sales/marketing day, however based on the temperature it appears sustainable.
In order to make this analysis water tight I would look into the weather patterns for the year. Example: Rainy, Windy weather, hurricane season etc. 
I'd also pay attention to which months bring in more tourest's. Optimizing sales is a big part in a successful business. We want to make sure there is enough inventory to supply the demand & vice versa, we want to make sure we dont over purchase items we cant sell.
